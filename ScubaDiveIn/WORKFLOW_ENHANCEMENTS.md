# ScubaDiveIn Workflow Enhancements

## Current Workflow Analysis

1. **User Authentication Gap**: The workflow doesn't explicitly require users to be logged in before booking, which limits personalization and tracking.

2. **Limited Pre-booking Information**: While course details are displayed, there's no mention of availability calendars or scheduling options.

3. **Basic Customer Data Collection**: Only collects name, email, and phone, missing opportunities for more detailed customer profiling.

4. **Single Payment Method**: Relies solely on Razorpay without alternatives.

5. **Manual Confirmation Process**: No automated email notifications mentioned in the current flow.
